This repository contains the Unity VR application developed for my master thesis @ University of Innsbruck:

## "Make me work for it" - Investigating the effect of pseudo-haptics on dynamic weight-lifting tasks in a virtual environment

This thesis investigates the potential of pseudo-haptics to simulate weight and enhance physical exertion in virtual reality (VR) training scenarios. While VR is increasingly used for immersive training, the lack of realistic haptic feedback remains a challenge, particularly for tasks requiring kinesthetic interaction. Pseudo-haptic techniques, which leverage discrepancies between visual and physical inputs, can create haptic sensations and offer a promising alternative to scenario-specific hardware.

The research of this thesis focuses on a dynamic weight-lifting task using a prototype application designed to simulate the shoveling of snow. Through controlled experiments, the impact of pseudo-haptic weight manipulations on both perceived and objectively measured exertion will be evaluated with a specific focus on the intensity of control-display (C/D) ratio manipulations and the integration of physical proxies.
