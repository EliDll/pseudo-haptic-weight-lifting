# pseudo-haptic-weight-lifting

This repository contains the Unity VR application developed for my master thesis @ University of Innsbruck:
___
## DISCLAIMER:

In its current state, the Unity application is dependent on an OptiTrack external tracking setup, as it relies on the [Optitrack Unity Plugin](https://docs.optitrack.com/plugins/optitrack-unity-plugin) for synchronization with the physical environment. Since this plugin operates on x86 DLL's, the applicaiton currently **only works via Quest Link and cannot be deployed to Android-based HMD's**. Feel free to contact me if you want an up-to-date, deployable standalone version and release.

## Thesis:
### *Make me work for it* - How Pseudo-Haptics can shape Exertion, Perception, and Behavior in Virtual Reality

Virtual Reality (VR) is increasingly used for immersive training, where realistic haptic feedback
is crucial for fidelity and maximizing skill transfer, particularly for tasks requiring kinesthetic
interaction. Pseudo-haptic feedback, which leverages discrepancies between physical input and
visual output, can elicit haptic sensations, such as weight or resistance, without the need for
additional, scenario-specific hardware. As such, it can be used to substitute, or augment physically
based haptic techniques.

While previous research has demonstrated the efficacy of pseudo-haptic
feedback under controlled conditions, little is known about its practical viability for prolonged,
complex, and physically demanding interaction tasks. We set out to understand whether pseudo-
haptic feedback can be utilized to make virtual object interaction feel more physically demanding,
and therefore more believable. To this end, we conducted a user study that investigates the
interplay between different intensities of pseudo-haptic feedback and choice of input modality, for
the sample task of virtual snow shoveling.

Our results demonstrate that, in terms of presence, precision, and perceived exertion, the input
modality of haptic proxies provides substantial benefits over motion controllers, especially for
bimanual interaction, while physical exertion, as measured through heart rate, remains similar
for both. In our experiments, pseudo-haptic feedback intensity influenced how quickly heart rate
progressed toward a sustainable threshold, suggesting subtle effects on physical workload. We
also observed that pseudo-haptic feedback decreased interaction presence when discrepancies in
displacement became noticeable, typically near the limits of human range of motion.

Ultimately, pseudo-haptic feedback proved effective at shaping how users feel and move in VR.
If carefully designed, it can heighten perceived effort, convey changes in kinesthetic properties,
and even encourage more natural user behavior. These findings suggest that pseudo-haptic
feedback can enhance immersive virtual training, and kinesthetic interaction in general, by
aligning perception and behavior in VR more closely with real-world activities.
